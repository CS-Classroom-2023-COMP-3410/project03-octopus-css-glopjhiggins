Assignment: Project 3

Overall this assignment was pretty easy to implement with the given commands. 
It was a bit difficult to find the exact padding and margins but I think I got it all matched up pretty well.
Adjusting the picture of the octopus was a bit difficult and I was unsure of how to handle it at first but 
I think using negative padding worked well and got it looking like the example.

Overall this was a fun project and it was fairly simple to implement. Seeing where to add in the CSS and change
the whole look of the website was really fun.
